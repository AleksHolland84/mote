Mounting Holes
==============

Both Mote and its accessories include mounting holes.

Mote USB Host
-------------

The Mote USB Host includes four 3mm mounting holes.

* The top two holes are spaced 41mm center to center,
* The bottom two holes are spaced 17mm center to center,
* The top and bottom sets of holes are spaced 15mm apart
* The right-most holes are aligned

The most USB host has an irregular shape, but broadly it's:

* 48mm wide and,
* 30mm long.
* The first set of holes are 12mm from the ports edge (to center),
* The second set of holes are 3mm from the opposite edge (to center),
* All holes are 3mm from their respective edges (to center)

A gap of 40mm from the ports edge and power edge is recommended inside any enclosure, to allow cables to flex without straining the ports. This can be squished down to 30mm.

The left-hand side of the bottom is inset by 8mm.
